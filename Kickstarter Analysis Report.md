Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?

1.	There are more successful campaigns than failed campaigns.
2.	Across all countries the theater category has the most campaigns for this data set.
3.	There has not been one successful journalism campaign.

What are some limitations of this dataset?

1.	We don’t know how many times the campaign was shared/advertised.
2.	We don’t know what media is included on the campaign page to explain and promote the project, or the length of the text description to describe the project.
3.	We don’t know the number of people working on the campaign.
4.	We don’t know about the level of pledges per campaign and what is rewarded to backers based on their donation.
5.	It’s a random selection of campaigns from 2009 – 2017.  It would be better if we could look at all the campaigns from each year and compare year over year.
6.	We don’t know if the people running the campaign have done one before, and if they have what their success rate is.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1.	Length of campaign compared to success rate
2.	If “staff pick” has an effect on success rate
3.	If “spotlight” has an effect on success rate
4.	Average Donation compared to success rate
5.	Average Donation by category and sub category
